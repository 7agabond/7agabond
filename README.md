- 👋 Hi, I’m @7agabond !
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, mods, tech, web design, and general programming !
- 🌱 I’m currently searching for my first programming job! My main language ATM is JavaScript, but I'm learning C#/.Net, C++, Python, and Java on the side! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to build my portfolio with collaborations and learning projects! Plus some more JS and HTML/CSS practice would be great.
